## Install

To use ts-node you may need to install it globally.
You may set a global NPM location like this

```
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.npm-global/bin
```

```
npm install typescript ts-node -g
```

You also need to make sure you are using node version at least 17

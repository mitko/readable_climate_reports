# Initial Thoughts on how to manage semantics and ontology

(see also https://github.com/petermr/petermr/discussions/27 which is generic on converting PDF to semantic form though inspired by this project)

Roughly these phases:

## syntactic:
Recover the Word or LaTeX documents created by the authors. Heuristic, hard

* characters
* words
* sentences
* paragraphs
* syntactic roles (mainly sub/headings) -> sections
* tables (even harder)
* figures (mainly captions and associated image/bitmap

## semantic
* Add meaning to sections (use JATS)
* recover 
- front
- body
- back
- floats
* recover image semantics (e.g. bar charts( . Hard

## Ontological
* map words onto Wikidata or other authority
* classify sections by content
* label components in diagrams
* provide semantic and ontological annotation
